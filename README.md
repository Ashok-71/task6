# Task 6 – Lists, Tuples & Sets (Python)

## 📌 Objective
To understand and implement Python collections: Lists, Tuples, and Sets.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- VS Code

## 📂 Task Description
This task demonstrates:
- List operations (add, remove, sort)
- Tuple usage for fixed data
- Removing duplicates using sets
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Iterating over collections
- Difference between mutable and immutable data types

## 📄 Files Included
- collections_demo.py – Python script demonstrating all required operations
- README.md – Task explanation

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Lists are mutable and ordered
- Tuples are immutable and faster for fixed data
- Sets automatically remove duplicates
- Set operations are useful for comparisons

## ✅ Final Outcome
A clear understanding of Python data structures and their use cases.
